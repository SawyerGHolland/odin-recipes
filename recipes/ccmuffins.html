    <p>
        Saturday morning was made for muffins. After a long week of work there is nothing better
        than starting off your weekend with some warm chocolate chip muffins. There is something 
        majestic about a warm muffin, saturday cartoons on the tv, and a day of relaxation ahead.

        A breakfast that can be enjoyed by everyone in the house is rare. This is one of those
        meals though, everyone loves muffins. The chocolate chips are a great touch due to the 
        child like wonder of eating sweets for a meal. This is a meal that will not help you on 
        a scale, but will help you with vibes.
