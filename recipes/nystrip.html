    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The best meal in the world is a perfectly cooked steak on a warm summer night.
            aroma of the grill is the most scentilating thing. Something great happens
            when the grill is going and there is marinated steak aout to go on. 
        </p>
        <p>Picture this, it is golden hour and there is a 12 oz. New York strip steak that
            has been marinated all day ready to be grilled. The fire is going, kids are playing
            in the yard with the dogs, and a cold drink in your hands. That is a perfect summer
            night and it all revolves around the perfect steak.
